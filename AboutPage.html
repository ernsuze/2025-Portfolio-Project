                    <p>I began my coding journey in late June 2024 after stumbling across videos by Leon Noel on YouTube. His content immediately hooked me, and I dove headfirst into learning. Since then, I’ve combined his teachings with resources from Codecademy and another fantastic YouTuber, BroCode, to build a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. <br><br>

My experience isn’t just limited to coding—my background in graphic design has given me a strong eye for aesthetics and user experience. I’ve learned wireframing through tools like Lucidchart and Figma, refining my skills through trial and error and school projects. Additionally, my college education introduced me to Tableau, SQL, and the significance of database management, expanding my technical skill set. <br><br>

My ultimate goal is to create my own AI, but along the way, I’m excited to build functional websites, apps, and even games. I love the process of bringing ideas to life through code and design.<br><br>
When I’m not coding, you can find me reading a book, crocheting, painting, running, or exploring new experiences. I’m constantly seeking inspiration and opportunities to challenge myself, creating new neural pathways and embracing growth.</p>
